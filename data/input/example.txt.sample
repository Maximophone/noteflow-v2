This is an example text file for testing NoteFlow v2.

When you copy this file to example.txt (removing the .sample extension),
the file watcher will detect it and create a job.

The pipeline will:
1. Run the text_echo processor to add a metadata header
2. Run the word_counter processor to generate statistics

You can watch the process in:
- The terminal where the server is running
- The UI at http://localhost:5173
- The API at http://localhost:8000/api/jobs

After processing, check:
- data/processed/ for the processed file
- data/stats/ for the statistics JSON

To test revert, use:
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/jobs/{job_id}/revert

This will delete the created files and reset the job.

Happy testing!
